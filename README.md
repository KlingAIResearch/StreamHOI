## News
- [x] [2026.1.27] **LongLive is accepted by ICLR-2026.** 🎉🎉🎉
- [x] [2026.1.11] Many thanks @qixinhu11 for adapting LongLive's original RoPE into KV-cache relative RoPE. Now LongLive supports generating infinite long videos!
- [x] [2025.12.4] We fix a bug in `global_sink==False` mode. Now our model generate videos in higher quality.
- [x] [2025.11.3] We implement LongLive on linear attention model [SANA-Video](https://nvlabs.github.io/Sana/Video/)! Now SANA-Video can generate 60s interactive videos in real-time.
- [x] [2025.11.1] The license has been changed from CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 to **Apache 2.0**.
- [x] [2025.10.11] Many thanks to @yondonfu for building an interactive UI based on LongLive. Please check it [here](https://github.com/daydreamlive/scope).
- [x] [2025.10.1] We compare Sora2 (+ GPT-5 prompt engineering) with LongLive-1.3B in the interactive long video generation. See [here](https://x.com/yukangchen_/status/1973405662177529993) for details.
- [x] [2025.9.30] We release [example prompts](https://github.com/NVlabs/LongLive/tree/main/example) to reproduce our demo videos.
- [x] [2025.9.29] We release [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22622), this GitHub repo [LongLive](https://github.com/NVlabs/LongLive) with all training and inference code, the model weight [LongLive-1.3B](https://huggingface.co/Efficient-Large-Model/LongLive-1.3B), and demo page [Website](https://nvlabs.github.io/LongLive).

## Highlights
1. **Long Video Gen**: LongLive supports up to 240s video generation, with visual consistency.
2. **Real-time Inference**: LongLive supports 20.7 FPS generation speed on a single H100 GPU, and 24.8 FPS with FP8 quantization with marginal quality loss.
3. **Efficient Fine-tuning**: LongLive extends a short-clip model to minute-long generation in 32 H100 GPU-days.

## Introduction
<p align="center" style="border-radius: 10px">
  <img src="assets/pipeline.jpg" width="100%" alt="logo"/>
<strong>LongLive accepts sequential user prompts and generates corresponding videos in real time, enabling user-guided long video generation.</strong>
